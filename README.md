## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I dove into a Python project on a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack because I was curious about cybersecurity. I wanted to see firsthand how attackers intercept and mess with communication between parties, showing why encryption and secure protocols matter. Python's handy libraries made it easy for network tinkering, letting me learn more about cybersecurity threats while brushing up on my coding skills.
